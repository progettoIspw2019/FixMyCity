The purpose of our system is to encourage and facilitate the collaboration of citizens and public companies, to improve management and maintenance of the city and its infrastructures. 

The system allows anyone to report a problem or write a proposal for the city. These reports can be directed to the community or to public or private companies. 
If the report is aimed at the community, citizens can join an event as volunteers in order to fix the problem. 
If a report is aimed at public companies, the system will automatically notify the company involved and they can approve or reject to work on it. In case of approval, they can keep citizens informed about any progress made. 

Users interact with the software through an intuitive and minimal graphical interface which makes the map of the city its main focus, showing nearby reports or events. The system will be multi-user and multi-role, allowing different kinds of actions for citizens and companies.
